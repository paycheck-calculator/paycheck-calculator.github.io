# Paycheck Calculator: Your Free Online Tool for Quick Pay Estimates

Hey everyone! If you're tired of scratching your head over how much you'll actually take home after taxes and deductions, I've got just the thing for you. Welcome to Paycheck Calculator, a super simple web app I built to help folks like you figure out their net pay without any hassle. It's all online at [paycheck-calculator.github.io](https://paycheck-calculator.github.io/), and it's completely free—no sign-ups, no ads, just straightforward calculations right in your browser.

I created this because, let's face it, payroll math can be a pain. Whether you're an employee checking your stubs or an employer estimating costs, this tool crunches the numbers for federal, state, and local taxes, plus stuff like Social Security, Medicare, and any custom deductions you throw in. It's designed to be user-friendly, so even if you're not a finance whiz, you can get accurate estimates in seconds.

## Key Features
Here's what makes this calculator stand out:
- **Gross to Net Pay Conversion**: Plug in your gross salary, hours worked, pay rate, and it spits out your net pay after all the usual withholdings.
- **Customizable Deductions**: Add pre-tax stuff like 401(k) contributions, health insurance, or even union dues. Post-tax deductions? Got those too.
- **Tax Bracket Awareness**: It uses up-to-date federal tax brackets (based on standard rates—always double-check with official sources for your situation).
- **State-Specific Options**: Select your state for more precise estimates on state income taxes.
- **Bi-weekly, Weekly, or Monthly Pay**: Handles different pay frequencies so you can see your take-home for the period that matters to you.
- **Overtime Calculator**: If you're pulling extra hours, it factors in overtime rates automatically.
- **Privacy First**: Everything runs client-side—no data is sent to servers, so your info stays with you.

It's perfect for freelancers, hourly workers, or anyone planning their budget. Just input your details, hit calculate, and boom—clear breakdown of where your money's going.

## How It Works
Using it is a breeze:
1. Head over to the site and enter your basic info: hourly rate or salary, hours per week, filing status (single, married, etc.).
2. Add any deductions or additional income sources.
3. Choose your pay frequency and state if needed.
4. Click "Calculate" and get a detailed report: gross pay, taxes broken down, deductions, and your final net pay.

I built it with real-world scenarios in mind, like handling multiple jobs or bonuses. Pro tip: Use it alongside your actual pay stubs to tweak your W-4 for better tax outcomes—no more surprises at tax time!
